# Keras, Tensorflow, and Python

Keras is a high-level API for Tensorflow, a deep learning framework. As of `Tensorflow 2.0`, keras is built-in. More details [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) and an article [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/10/21/keras-vs-tf-keras-whats-the-difference-in-tensorflow-2-0/)

With the upgrade of Macs to Apple Hardware, installing tensorflow is a bit more cumbersome. Be careful as this may mess with your Anaconda environment and settings. Read these pages for [instillation instructions](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/) and the `tensorflow-macos` Python package [repo](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos).
